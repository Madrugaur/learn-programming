# Learn Programming

```
Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.

## Introduction
The financial success of tech companies (and the code monkeys they call "software engineers") has inspired a lot of people to pick up programming either out of curiosity or an interest to break into the industry. Bootcamps and courses, free and paid, as well as community and four-year college degrees all offer paths to build programming skills. Some even choose to forego any structured program and "self-teach" computer science (CS). I want to give a few reality checks on the topic of learning how to program before moving on.

### 1. There is no easy way
Learning to program at _any_ level is just plain hard. People who have programmed for 15 years will have just as much trouble wrestling with new concepts as programmers with 15 minutes of experience. Obviously the older programmer will take on more complex and challenging ideas, but the experience of feeling "too stupid" to understand something is universal across all skill levels.

Successful programmers are A) aware that it will never get easier and B) are patient and kind to themselves as they tackle new concepts. Kind of like training for a race: the running doesn't hurting as you get in better shape; you just do it faster. A programmer's ability to learn harder ideas improves drastically over their career in large part because they develop a stronger tolerance for sitting with the discomfort of not understanding something.

"Being smart" is the asset you'll lean on that affects _what_ your brain is able to reason about and _how quickly_ it can develop the ability to do so. There are very few concepts in the introductory levels of computer science that an adult brain physically _cannot_ reason about. However, there are many concepts in entry-level CS that will take adult brains a long time to understand. The key is to give your brain time to do so.

Good programmers are patient with themselves, aware that developing deep understanding takes time, and are secure in the fact that they'll figure it out _eventually_.

### 2. There is a best way
Contrary to much of the rhetoric on the internet, earning a four-year degree is clearly the most effective and straightforward path to becoming a strong programmer. It's by no means a guaranteed path (I've seen plenty of smart kids drop out of CS programs, but only ever because they gave up). But, it's likely more effective than other routes.

Short of a college degree, surrounding yourself with people who are passionate about programming, excited to help, and learning about it themselves is the best option.
